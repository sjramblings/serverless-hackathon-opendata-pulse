# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The OpenData Pulse system requires comprehensive infrastructure and data flow documentation to enable developers, operators, and stakeholders to understand the system architecture, data processing pipelines, and operational procedures. This documentation will serve as the authoritative reference for system understanding, troubleshooting, and future development.

## Requirements

2. WHEN reviewing the architecture THEN the documentation SHALL include visual diagrams using Mermaid syntax showing service interactions and data flow
3. WHEN examining CDK stacks THEN the documentation SHALL explain the purpose and dependencies of each stack (DataStack, ComputeStack, APIStack, FrontendStack, LocationStack)
4. WHEN understanding resource naming THEN the documentation SHALL provide clear naming conventions and examples for all AWS resources

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want detailed data flow documentation, so that I can monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize data processing pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data enters the system THEN the documentation SHALL describe the complete ingestion process from NSW API to storage with Mermaid flow diagrams
2. WHEN data is processed THEN the documentation SHALL explain each ETL transformation step with input/output formats using Mermaid sequence diagrams
3. WHEN data is queried THEN the documentation SHALL show how data flows from storage through GraphQL API to frontend with Mermaid flowcharts
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the documentation SHALL provide troubleshooting guides for each data processing stage
5. WHEN monitoring the system THEN the documentation SHALL explain all CloudWatch metrics, alarms, and logging patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want deployment and operational documentation, so that I can maintain and scale the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN the documentation SHALL provide step-by-step deployment procedures for each environment
2. WHEN scaling resources THEN the documentation SHALL explain capacity planning and auto-scaling configurations
3. WHEN managing costs THEN the documentation SHALL document resource costs and optimization strategies
4. WHEN handling incidents THEN the documentation SHALL provide runbooks for common operational scenarios
5. WHEN updating the system THEN the documentation SHALL explain rollback procedures and deployment validation steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want comprehensive API documentation, so that I can integrate with the OpenData Pulse system programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the GraphQL API THEN the documentation SHALL provide complete schema documentation with examples
2. WHEN authenticating THEN the documentation SHALL explain Cognito integration and token management
3. WHEN using MCP tools THEN the documentation SHALL document all 5+ available tools with usage examples
4. WHEN handling errors THEN the documentation SHALL provide error codes, messages, and resolution steps
5. WHEN rate limiting applies THEN the documentation SHALL explain limits and best practices for API usage

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want security and compliance documentation, so that I can verify the system meets security requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing access controls THEN the documentation SHALL detail all IAM roles, policies, and permissions
2. WHEN examining data protection THEN the documentation SHALL explain encryption at rest and in transit
3. WHEN auditing network security THEN the documentation SHALL document VPC configurations, security groups, and network ACLs
4. WHEN reviewing compliance THEN the documentation SHALL map security controls to relevant compliance frameworks
5. WHEN incident response is needed THEN the documentation SHALL provide security incident response procedures

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want data schema and query documentation, so that I can effectively analyze and extract insights from the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying raw data THEN the documentation SHALL provide complete S3 data structure and partitioning schemes
2. WHEN accessing processed data THEN the documentation SHALL explain DynamoDB schema design and access patterns
3. WHEN using Athena THEN the documentation SHALL provide example queries and performance optimization tips
4. WHEN understanding data lineage THEN the documentation SHALL trace data from source through all transformations
5. WHEN working with geographic data THEN the documentation SHALL explain Location Service integration and coordinate systems
